#Project Specification

## Supply Chain Analysis Tool

### Overview

This feature is intended to help board directors stay informed about potential supply chain disruptions by using ai to analyze news articles and displaying relevant data points on a map.

The prototype should be designed using Apple as the company in question. Therefore, only supply chain disruptions that are relevant to Apple should be shown on the map.

### Deliverable

A link to the live project should be provided on completion. The map should be populated with data points on load. Clicking on a data point should bring up a tooltip with information about the incident and the business implications.

### Notes

You should spend no more than 5 hours on this project. If the deliverable is completed in less than 5 hours, you are encouraged to add any additional functionality that you deem appropriate with the remaining time. You are free to choose your own solution for storing data. You will need to sign up for a free news api account and get an api key (link below). The data should be refreshed at least once an hour.
